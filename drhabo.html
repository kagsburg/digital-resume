            <h1>Built a Hospital management system for Gynecologist</h1>

            <p>As a software developer, 
                I worked on a hospital management system for a gynecologist that aimed to streamline 
                the patient check-in to checkout process. 
                The system was built using modern web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Github and MySQL.</p>

            <p>Some of the key features of the system included a patient registration portal, 
                appointment scheduling, electronic medical records, billing and payment management, 
                and reporting. The system also allowed for real-time communication between doctors and nurses, 
                as well as automatic alerts for patients with upcoming appointments.</p>
            <p>Throughout the development process, I worked closely with the Hospital staff to ensure that the system met their specific needs and requirements.
                I also provided thorough documentation to ensure that the system could be easily maintained and updated in the future.

                <li>It helped improve patient care by streamlining administrative tasks 
                    and providing easy access to patient information.</li>
                <li>It  helped healthcare professionals make more informed decisions based on real-time data, 
                    leading to better patient outcomes.</li>
