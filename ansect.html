            <h1>Built a Ancestry Api</h1>

            <ul>
                <!-- <li><a href="https://drhabo.com">Live Demo</a></li> -->

            </ul>
            
            <p>Ancestry API is a project I worked on which involved developing a RESTful API using Python FastAPI and MongoDB. 
                The API was designed to allow users to search for information about their ancestors and build family trees. 
                I was responsible for implementing the back-end logic, database integration, and API endpoints.</p>

            <p>The main features of the API include search functionality for ancestors based on name, birth/death dates, and location. 
                It also allows users to add/edit family tree information, including adding new ancestors and relationships between them. 
                The API was secured with authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.</p>
            <p>Throughout the project, I adhered to best practices for API development, such as implementing versioning, error handling, and documentation using Swagger UI. 
                I also conducted extensive testing to ensure the API's functionality, performance, and scalability.
            </p>            

            <p>The outcome of the project was a fully functional and scalable API that met the client's requirements for ancestry research and family tree building. 
                The API was successfully deployed and integrated into the client's website, providing users with a reliable and efficient way to search and manage their ancestral data.</p>
