            <h1>Built a Cloud Firebase Notification</h1>

            <ul>
                <!-- <li><a href="https://drhabo.com">Live Demo</a></li> -->

            </ul>
            
            <p>I built a cloud Firebase notification and Scheduling system using Firebase Python SDK integrated with Django. 
                The project involved setting up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and creating a back-end system to enable sending notifications to mobile devices and web apps. 
                The implementation included configuring the Firebase project, setting up a Firebase Admin SDK, and integrating Firebase Cloud Messaging with Django.
            </p>

            <p>The system allowed for sending notifications to individual devices or device groups based on predefined topics. The notifications could also be customized with a title, message, and data payload. 
                The system provided real-time updates on notification delivery status, and the dashboard allowed for tracking the number of notifications sent and received.</p>
            <p>The outcome of the Firebase notification app built using Firebase Python SDK with javascript, 
                Django is a reliable and efficient platform for sending push notifications to users. 
                With the integration of Firebase services, the app offers seamless and real-time messaging capabilities to its users, helping to improve user engagement and retention. 
                The app provides a user-friendly interface for sending notifications, and its integration with Django framework offers additional features such as user authentication and authorization, making it a secure and robust platform for managing push notifications. 
                Overall, the Firebase notification app offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for businesses to communicate with their users in real-time.
            </p>
