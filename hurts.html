            <h1>Built a RHF API (Rape Hurts Foundation)
            </h1>

                <!-- <li><a href="https://github.com/kagsburg/familytree-api">Source code</a></li> -->
            </ul>
            
            <p>I worked on developing an API for the Rape Hurts project using Django and Python. 
                My responsibilities included designing and implementing the API endpoints, handling database queries and optimizing query performance, 
                and integrating the API with the front-end of the application.</p>

            <p>To achieve this, I utilized Django Rest Framework to create a RESTful API with JSON responses. 
                I implemented authentication and authorization for secure data access and implemented data validation to ensure data integrity. 
                Additionally, I designed the database schema using MySQL and optimized queries for efficient data retrieval. </p>
            <p>The outcome of the project was a functional and scalable API that allowed users to access and manage data related to sexual violence. 
                The API had various endpoints that provided access to resources such as user accounts, support centers, legal aid centers, and self-care resources. 
                The API had features such as user authentication,rate limiting, data validation, and error handling to ensure that data was securely managed and processed. 
                It was designed with a robust and scalable architecture that could handle high traffic and large amounts of data.
            </p>            

            <p>Overall, the project helped to provide a critical resource for survivors of sexual violence and those who support them. The API enabled users to easily access resources and services that could help them heal and recover from trauma.</p>
