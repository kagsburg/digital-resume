            <h1>Built a Harvest Foods Ecommerce System</h1>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://web.harvestfoods.ug">Live Demo</a></li>
                <!-- <li><a href="#">Source code</a></li> -->
            </ul>
            
            <p>For the Harvest Food restaurant, I created a web platform from scratch that allowed customers to order food online. 
                I built the platform using a combination of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SlimPHP, and MySQL.</p>

            <p>As part of the project, I also developed a RESTful API to support the website functionality. 
                The website featured a user-friendly interface with secure login and registration systems, a menu displaying various food options and prices, 
                and the ability for customers to customize their orders.Additionally, the website incorporated a payment gateway and order tracking system to help customers track the progress of their orders. 
                Throughout the development process, I ensured that the website was responsive and mobile-friendly.</p>
            <p>The outcome of the Harvest Food restaurant ordering website and API project was a seamless user experience for customers to place their orders online. 
                The website was designed with a user-friendly interface that allowed customers to view the menu, select their items, and place their orders easily. 
                The API was integrated with the website to ensure that orders were processed efficiently and accurately.
            </p>            

            <p>The MySQL database was used to store all the necessary information about the restaurant, menu items, and customer orders. 
                The use of SlimPHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP ensured that the website and API were scalable, efficient, and easy to maintain. 
                Overall, the project was a success, and the restaurant was able to increase its customer base through the online ordering system. 
                This helped to boost the restaurantâ€™s sales and also get customer feedback quickly
