            <h1>Built a Chato Website
            </h1>

            <ul>
                <!-- <li><a href="https://web.harvestfoods.ug">Live Demo</a></li> -->
                <li><a href="https://github.com/kagsburg/laravel_blog_website">Source code</a></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> This website was developed for a hotel and has both admin section and Customer section.
            </p>

            <p>The website has a designated area accessible only to administrators. This section is typically password-protected and provides functionalities that are not available to regular users. Administrators have the authority to manage various aspects of the website.
            </p>
            <p>As part of my involvement, I was responsible for working on this specific website. This could include tasks like:

            </p>    
            <ul>
                <li>Developing new features or functionalities for the website.
                </li>
                <li>Modifying existing code to enhance performance or add new capabilities.
                </li>
                <li>Fixing bugs or issues that arose during development or after deployment.
                </li>
                <li>Collaborating with other team members, such as designers or front-end developers, to ensure a seamless user experience.</li>
                
            </ul>        

            <p>By working on this project, I contributed to the successful development and maintenance of the Chato website. 
                I helped ensure that the admin section was functional and user-friendly, providing the necessary tools for administrators to manage the website effectively.
            </p>
            <p>Overall, I was involved using the Laravel framework to work on the Chato website, 
                specifically focusing on the development and maintenance of the admin section, 
                which is a critical part of the website's functionality.</p>
